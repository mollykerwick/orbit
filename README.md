# orbit
A simple model of the orbits of Earth and Jupiter around the sun. Model in C++ with a simple plot in Python. You can use this model to simulate what would happen to the orbit of these planets if the mass of the planets and/or the mass of the sun changed.

Needed: Pandas and Matplotlib.pyplot



To run this simple simulation:

`g++ -g orbit.cpp -o orbit -Wall`

`./orbit`

`python3 plot.py`
